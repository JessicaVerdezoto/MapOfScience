AB  - Most genomes within the species complex of Fusarium oxysporum are organized into two 
      compartments: the core chromosomes (CCs) and accessory chromosomes (ACs). As opposed 
      to CCs, which are conserved and vertically transmitted to carry out essential 
      housekeeping functions, lineage- or strain-specific ACs are believed to be initially 
      horizontally acquired through unclear mechanisms. These two genomic compartments are 
      different in terms of gene density, the distribution of transposable elements, and 
      epigenetic markers. Although common in eukaryotes, the functional importance of ACs 
      is uniquely emphasized among fungal species, specifically in relationship to fungal 
      pathogenicity and their adaptation to diverse hosts. With a focus on the 
      cross-kingdom fungal pathogen F. oxysporum, this review provides a summary of the 
      differences between CCs and ACs based on current knowledge of gene functions, genome 
      structures, and epigenetic signatures, and explores the transcriptional crosstalk 
      between the core and accessory genomes.

AB  - Watermelon is an important commercial crop in the Southeastern United States and 
      around the world. However, production is significantly limited by biotic factors 
      including fusarium wilt caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus Fusarium oxysporum forma 
      specialis niveum (Fon). Unfortunately, this disease has increased significantly in 
      its presence over the last several decades as races have emerged which can overcome 
      the available commercial resistance. Management strategies include rotation, 
      improved crop resistance, and chemical control, but early and accurate diagnostics 
      are required for appropriate management. Accurate diagnostics require molecular and 
      genomic strategies due to the near identical genomic sequences of the various races. 
      Bioassays exist for evaluating both the pathogenicity and virulence of an isolate 
      but are limited by the time and resources required. Molecular strategies are still 
      imperfect but greatly reduce the time to complete the diagnosis. This article 
      presents the current state of the research surrounding races, both how races have 
      been detected and diagnosed in the past and future prospects for improving the 
      system of differentiation. Additionally, the available Fon genomes were analyzed 
      using a strategy previously described in separate formae speciales avirulence gene 
      association studies in Fusarium oxysporum races.

      oxysporum.
PG  - 882-895
LID - 10.1111/mpp.13068 [doi]
AB  - Fusarium oxysporum is a well-known soilborne plant pathogen that causes severe 
      vascular wilt in economically important crops worldwide. During the infection 
      process, F. oxysporum not only secretes various virulence factors, such as cell 
      wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), effectors, and mycotoxins, that potentially play 
      important roles in fungal pathogenicity but it must also respond to extrinsic 
      abiotic stresses from the environment and the host. Over 700 transcription factors 
      (TFs) have been predicted in the genome of F. oxysporum, but only 26 TFs have been 
      functionally characterized in various formae speciales of F. oxysporum. Among these 
      TFs, a total of 23 belonging to 10 families are required for pathogenesis through 
      various mechanisms and pathways, and the zinc finger TF family is the largest family 
      among these 10 families, which consists of 15 TFs that have been functionally 
      characterized in F. oxysporum. In this review, we report current research progress 
      on the 26 functionally analysed TFs in F. oxysporum and sort them into four groups 
      based on their roles in F. oxysporum pathogenicity. Furthermore, we summarize and 
      compare the biofunctions, involved pathways, putative targets, and homologs of these 
      TFs and analyse the relationships among them. This review provides a systematic 
      analysis of the regulation of virulence-related genes and facilitates further 
      mechanistic analysis of TFs important in F. oxysporum virulence.

AB  - Fusarium oxysporum is a large species complex of both plant and human pathogens that 
      attack a diverse array of species in a host-specific manner. Comparative genomic 
      studies have revealed that the host-specific pathogenicity of the F. oxysporum 
      species complex (FOSC) was determined by distinct sets of supernumerary (SP) 
      chromosomes. In contrast to common vertical transfer, where genetic materials are 
      transmitted via cell division, SP chromosomes can be transmitted horizontally 
      between phylogenetic lineages, explaining the polyphyletic nature of the 
      host-specific pathogenicity of the FOSC. The existence of a diverse array of SP 
      chromosomes determines the broad host range of this species complex, while the 
      conserved core genome maintains essential house-keeping functions. Recognition of 
      these SP chromosomes enables the functional and structural compartmentalization of 
      F. oxysporum genomes. In this review, we examine the impact of this group of 
      cross-kingdom pathogens on agricultural productivity and human health. Focusing on 
      the pathogenicity of F. oxysporum in the phylogenomic framework of the genus 
      Fusarium, we elucidate the evolution of pathogenicity within the FOSC. We conclude 
      that a population genomics approach within a clearly defined phylogenomic framework 
      is essential not only for understanding the evolution of the pathogenicity mechanism 
      but also for identifying informative candidates associated with pathogenicity that 
      can be developed as targets in disease management programs.

AB  - Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) is a notorious pathogen that significantly contributes to 
      yield losses in crops of high economic status. It is responsible for vascular wilt 
      characterized by the browning of conductive tissue, wilting, and plant death. 
      Individual strains of Fo are host specific (formae speciales), and approximately, 
      150 forms have been documented so far. The pathogen secretes small effector proteins 
      in the xylem, termed as Secreted in Xylem (Six), that contribute to its virulence. 
      Most of these proteins contain cysteine residues in even numbers. These proteins are 
      encoded by SIX genes that reside on mobile pathogenicity chromosomes. So far, 14 
      proteins have been reported. However, formae speciales vary in SIX protein profile 
      and their respective gene sequence. Thus, SIX genes have been employed as ideal 
      markers for pathogen identification. Acquisition of SIX-encoding mobile 
      pathogenicity chromosomes by non-pathogenic lines, through horizontal transfer, 
      results in the evolution of new virulent lines. Recently, some SIX genes present on 
      these pathogenicity chromosomes have been shown to be involved in defining variation 
      in host specificity among formae speciales. Along these lines, the review entails 
      the variability (formae speciales, races, and vegetative compatibility groups) and 
      evolutionary relationships among members of F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC). It 
      provides updated information on the diversity, structure, regulation, and 
      (a)virulence functions of SIX genes. The improved understanding of roles of SIX in 
      variability and virulence of Fo has significant implication in establishment of 
      molecular framework and techniques for disease management. Finally, the review 
      identifies the gaps in current knowledge and provides insights into potential 
      research landscapes that can be explored to strengthen the understanding of 
      functions of SIX genes.

TI  - Fusarium oxysporum causes black gill disease in narrow-clawed crayfish Pontastacus 
      leptodactylus.

AB  - Morphological and molecular analyses were carried out to determine the causative 
      agent of black gill disease in narrow-clawed crayfish Pontastacus leptodactylus 
      specimens collected from 6 lakes (Taşkısığı, Beyşehir, Karaidemir, Karataş, Manyas, 
      and Gölhisar) in Turkey. Fungi were isolated from the tissues of crayfish displaying 
      putative black gill disease symptoms. Morphological evaluation was conducted, and 
      the isolates were determined to be similar to Fusarium oxysporum. Subsequent 
      molecular cloning of the ITS region of nrDNA by PCR confirmed species 
      identification; DNA sequences from all 6 isolates were 99% similar to those of F. 
      oxysporum. An experimental infection trial was conducted in triplicate using 1 of 
      the 6 isolates to fulfill Koch's postulates. Three groups of crayfish were used: (1) 
      wounded and contaminated (WC), (2) wounded and not contaminated (WNC), and (3) 
      non-wounded and contaminated (NWC). On Day 3, one individual died in the WC group. 
      Throughout the total 74 d monitoring period, no other mortality was recorded. On Day 
      14, all crayfish in the WC group showed blackened gills, whereas all crayfish in the 
      NWC displayed partial blackening and all crayfish in the WNC group displayed normal 
      gill coloration. F. oxysporum was re-isolated in pure culture from the WC and NWC 
      groups; thus, the disease was confirmed. Our results indicated that F. oxysporum 
      causes black gill disease in P. leptodactylus crayfish. Moreover, we demonstrated 
      that F. oxysporum can also infect non-wounded crayfish.

TI  - Fusarium nirenbergiae (Fusarium oxysporum Species Complex) Causing the Wilting of 
      Passion Fruit in Italy.
LID - 10.3390/plants10102011 [doi]
LID - 2011
AB  - Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims.) is an ever-increasing interest crop in Italy 
      because it is mainly cultivated for its edible fruit and, secondly, as an ornamental 
      evergreen climber. During the summer of 2020, two-year-old plants of purple passion 
      fruit in one of the most important expanding production areas of Sicily (southern 
      Italy) showed symptoms of yellowing, wilting, and vascular discoloration. 
      Fusarium-like fungal colonies were consistently yielded from symptomatic crown and 
      stem tissues. Five representative isolates were characterized by a morphological and 
      molecular analysis based on a multilocus phylogeny using RNA polymerase's second 
      largest subunit (RPB2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) genes, as 
      Fusarium nirenbergiae (Fusarium oxysporum species complex). Pathogenicity tests 
      conducted on healthy 1-year-old passion fruit cuttings revealed symptoms similar to 
      those observed in the field. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium 
      wilt on passion fruit caused by Fusarium nirenbergiae. This report focuses on the 
      phytopathological implications of this fungal pathogen, which may represent a future 
      significant threat for the expanding passion fruit production in Italy and Europe.

TI  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation Method for Fusarium oxysporum.
PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-1795-3_6 [doi]
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) is becoming a popular 
      effective system as an insertional mutagenesis tool in filamentous fungi. An 
      efficient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation approach was developed 
      for the plant pathogenic fungus, F. oxysporum, the causal agent of Apple replant 
      disease (ARD) in China. Four parameters were selected to optimize efficiencies of 
      transformation. A. tumefaciens concentration, conidial concentration of F. 
      oxysporum, and co-culture temperature and time have a significant influence on all 
      parameters. Transformants emit green fluorescence under fluorescence microscopy. The 
      integration of a mitotically stable hygromycin resistance gene (hph) in the genome 
      is confirmed by PCR. The transformation efficiency can reach up to 300 transformants 
      per 10(6) conidia under optimal conditions. This ATMT method is an efficient tool 
      for insertional mutagenesis of F. oxysporum.

TI  - Detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae by Using Loop-Mediated Isothermal 
      Amplification.
PG  - 1072-1079
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0590-RE [doi]
AB  - We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detecting 
      Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, the causal agent of wilt in strawberry plants. 
      This assay was based on genomic regions between the portions of transposable 
      elements Han and Skippy of the fungus. The LAMP assay allowed the efficient 
      detection of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae DNA by visual inspection, without 
      requiring gel electrophoresis. The detection limit was 100 pg of genomic DNA, which 
      is comparable to that of PCR. The LAMP primers successfully discriminated F. 
      oxysporum f. sp. fragariae strains from nonpathogenic F. oxysporum strains and other 
      fungi. The LAMP assay at 63°C, which was found to be the optimal treatment 
      temperature, for 1.5 h successfully detected F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae 
      California strains GL1270 and GL1385. When the assay was performed using a Genelyzer 
      FIII portable fluorometer, these California strains were successfully detected in 1 
      h. The assay facilitated the detection of conidia in soil samples after they were 
      precultured on a selective medium for F. oxysporum (FoG2) as well as latent 
      infection in strawberry plants after preculturing. The LAMP assay for visual 
      inspection of DNA required only a heating block and an incubator, reducing the cost 
      of this assay. Thus, it could be suitable for the detection of F. oxysporum f. sp. 
      fragariae strains in centers that store prefoundation and foundation stocks of 
      strawberry, including plant nurseries.
